      <h2>Why I want to work at Remote</h2>
      <p>
        When I relocated to Berlin to work for Fidor, I went through the painstaking process of handling visas,
        paperwork, and logistics largely on my own. It made me realize how overwhelming global mobility can be for
        individuals. That’s why I admire what Remote is solving — making relocation seamless and empowering people to
        work anywhere. At Dealfront today, I see Remote’s value even more clearly as we use it to manage employees
        across different geographies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve spent 10+ years scaling backend systems across fintech, healthcare, education, and B2B SaaS. At Dealfront,
        I cut API response times in half and built automation modules that power lead management at scale. At KeepWorks,
        I ran engineering, built APIs in REST and GraphQL, integrated with complex EMRs, and mentored a team while driving
        down technical debt. At Fidor, I led backend and iOS devs to ship a banking app under tight deadlines. The common
        thread? I deliver impact fast, in whatever stack is needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span id="letter-company-inline">Remote Technology, Inc.</span>’s stack may be Elixir, Phoenix, Postgres — my
        background is Ruby on Rails, Postgres, GraphQL, AWS. With enough miles logged across tech stacks, I know that
        languages change, but the ability to design, build, and ship great systems doesn’t. I thrive in async, distributed
        teams, and I love owning outcomes from start to ship.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re looking for someone who can drop into complex backend problems, adapt fast, and help <span id="company-first">Remote</span>
        scale the systems that power borderless work — that’s me.
      </p>

      <p>Let’s build the future of work together.</p>
      <p>All the best,<br />Sridhar Belagod</p>
