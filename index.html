    <!-- About Me / Introduction -->
    <section id="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I've spent 10+ years scaling backend systems across fintech, healthcare, education, and B2B SaaS.
        My experience ranges from reducing API response times, building automation modules for lead management,
        mentoring teams, integrating with complex EMRs, to leading backend and iOS teams to ship apps under tight
        deadlines.
        I thrive in async, distributed teams and love owning outcomes from start to ship.

      <h2>Why I Want to Work at Remote</h2>
      <p>
        When I relocated to Berlin to work for Fidor, I went through the painstaking process of handling visas,
        paperwork, and logistics largely on my own. It made me realize how overwhelming global mobility can be for
        individuals. That’s why I admire what Remote is solving — making relocation seamless and empowering people to
        work anywhere. At Dealfront today, I see Remote’s value even more clearly as we use it to manage employees
        across different geographies.

      <h2>Skills & Experience</h2>
      <p>
        <span id="letter-company-inline">Remote</span>'s stack may be Elixir, Phoenix, Postgres — my
        background is Ruby on Rails, Postgres, GraphQL, AWS. With enough miles logged across tech stacks, I know that
        languages change, but the ability to design, build, and ship great systems doesn't.

        If you're looking for someone who can drop into complex backend problems, adapt fast, and help <span

        scale the systems that power borderless work - that's me.
