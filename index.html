    <!-- About Me / Introduction -->
    <section id="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I've spent 10+ years scaling backend systems across education, healthcare, education, and B2B SaaS.
        My experience ranges from reducing API response times, building automation modules for lead management,
        mentoring teams, integrating with complex EMRs, to leading backend and iOS teams to ship apps under tight
        deadlines.
        I thrive in async, distributed teams and love owning outcomes from start to ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I'm a proud father of a wonderful daughter who keeps me on my toes, and I enjoy unwinding by
        playing games on my PlayStation.
        I believe balancing family, hobbies, and work fuels creativity and resilience in everything I do.

      <h2>What I Do at Dealfront</h2>
      <p>
        At Dealfront, I work on <a href="https://www.dealfront.com/web-visitors/" target="_blank">Web Visitors</a>, a
        product that helps customers understand and act on the companies visiting their websites.
        My focus is on building and maintaining the backend systems that power visitor timelines, automation, and
        reporting.
        Some of my key contributions include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Building and maintaining the visitor timeline that surfaces website activity in a clear, actionable way.
        </li>
        <li>Developing automation modules such as lead assignment and automated lead emails to streamline sales
          workflows.</li>
        <li>Designing and shipping weekly email reports summarizing key visitor insights, in close collaboration with
          product and design teams.</li>
        <li>Leading multiple feature releases involving large-scale backfilling of data and migration of legacy systems
          to newer architectures, ensuring smooth rollouts with careful scheduling and clear communication.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These experiences have sharpened my ability to deliver reliable features end-to-end, coordinate across teams,
        and ensure scalability in a fast-moving product environment.

    <!-- Why I Want to Work Here -->
    <section id="why-remote">
      <h2>Why I Want to Work at Remote</h2>
      <p>
        When I relocated to Berlin to work for Fidor, I went through the painstaking process of handling visas,
        paperwork, and logistics largely on my own. It made me realize how overwhelming global mobility can be for
        individuals. That's why I admire what Remote is solving - making relocation seamless and empowering people to
        work anywhere. At Dealfront today, I see Remote's value even more clearly as we use it to manage employees
        across different geographies.

      <h2>Skills & Experience</h2>
      <p>
        <span id="letter-company-inline">Remote</span>'s stack may be Elixir, Phoenix, Postgres - my
        background is Ruby on Rails, Postgres, GraphQL, AWS. With enough miles logged across tech stacks, I know that
        languages change, but the ability to design, build, and ship great systems doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're looking for someone who can drop into complex backend problems, adapt fast, and help <span

        scale the systems that power borderless work - that's me.
